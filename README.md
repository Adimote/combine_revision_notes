# Combine Revision Notes Tool

This tool combines all of your various revision notes into one big PDF, with title pages separating them.

Here's why I think this is useful:
- You can just search the PDF for any time a keyword is mentioned and get the definition
- There's no need for the context switch when you swap between different slide sets.
- The PDF can be read on an e-reader if you revise with one of those.

Requirements:

- Pandoc
- Libreoffice
- unoconv
- Stapler
